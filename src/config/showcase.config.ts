 * Showcase Configuration
 *
 * Real sites built with Astro Rocket, rendered on the `/showcase` page.
 * Add an entry to the array below and the page updates on its own — no
 * component edits needed. Screenshots are optional: drop one in
 * `src/assets/showcase/`, import it here, and the card swaps its
 * placeholder for the image.
 *
 * Want your site listed on the theme's own showcase? Open a
 * "Showcase submission" issue: see `showcaseSubmitUrl` below.
